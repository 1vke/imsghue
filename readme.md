# imsghue
`imsghue` is a rootless jailbreak tweak for iOS.

The goal for this tweak is to allow for the customization of text balloons, as well as other miscellaneous things throughout the Messages app.

I am making this project to give myself an introduction into the Objective-C language, low level programming languages, and the idea of hooking and manipulating the general function of things in iOS. 

# Disclaimer
I am in no way responsible if you do harm to your device with this tweak. It is very unlikely to happen, but this is a learning project for me and I will not vouch for the quality of this tweak.

# Usage
At this time, this has only been tested on my personal device that is on iOS 16.3, with Dopamine 2.0. 

I use macOS to build/compile this tweak. As of right now, it does not require any private libraries that might not work with theos's patched sdk's.

Installation should be as simple as running a `make do`.
